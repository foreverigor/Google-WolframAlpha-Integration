Google-WolframAlpha-Integration
===============================

Chrome Extension that integrates Wolfram|Alpha results into Google.

Under development.

Google Now isn't bad, for sure, but it's no question that Wolfram|Alpha has sometimes better and definitely more results.
So we thought it would be nice to **provide those Wolfram|Alpha information** just in your Google search result - always then **when Google Now quits the service.**
